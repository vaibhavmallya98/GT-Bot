Should I apply to the Ph.D. program or to the Master?s program?,"If your goal is ultimately to get a Ph.D. from Georgia Tech, you should apply to the Ph.D. program. You do not need to already have a Master?s degree to apply to or be admitted to the Ph.D. program.

Note that our admission standards for students applying to the Ph.D. program are higher than for those who are applying to the Master?s program. In particular, for Ph.D. applicants there is a greater emphasis on a broader set of criteria, such as your personal statement, letters of recommendation, and prior research/work experience. Does this mean that you should not apply for the Ph.D. program even if you are ultimately interested in a Ph.D.? We do not recommend this. Financial assistance (in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, or research assistantships with ECE faculty) are generally offered only to students applying to the Ph.D. program."
Are the application deadline dates firm?,Yes.
Can someone in ECE tell me if I am likely to be admitted?,We do not ?pre-evaluate? applicants? qualifications for graduate school in ECE. Requesting evaluations from faculty/staff via email is highly discouraged.
Do you require all letters of recommendation to be submitted online?,"Yes. Given the large number of applications that we receive, the online letters are much easier to track and to disseminate to the faculty who make the admissions and financial aid decisions."
"Submitting GRE scores is ?optional."" What does this mean?","We do not require applicants to submit GRE scores. They are not expected, but if you have taken the GREs and would like to include them, they will be considered. Strong GRE scores can potentially help make up for weakness in another area of your application, but GRE scores are not a primary factor in admissions decisions."
"I need help funding my education, how can I obtain a graduate teaching assistantship (GTA) or graduate research assistantship (GRA)?","Admitted M.S. students can apply for GTA funding after enrollment in the first semester. Students can fill out the position request form at the secured ECE site. Those seeking GRAs are encouraged to reach out directly to faculty with a shared research interest to discuss GRA opportunities. GTA/GRA funding is very limited and is not guaranteed. M.S. students should have an alternative plan for funding their degree. Most applicants admitted to the Atlanta campus Ph.D. program will receive a GTA or GRA offer. This will be noted in your acceptance letter. In the event funding is not offered, students will need to have an alternate plan for funding their degree. The Office of Graduate Studies fellowships page maintains links to external national fellowships that may be of interest."
"How can I check the status of my application or check if my application materials (transcripts, test scores, etc.) have been received by Georgia Tech?","Applications, transcripts, test scores, and other application materials sent to Georgia Tech are received and processed by theÿGeorgia Tech Office of Graduate Studies. To check your application status and/or what materials have been received by Georgia Tech, go to theÿapplication status checking page. On this page you can view the most current information regarding the status of your application including received materials."
"My supporting documents such as my transcript (or GRE or TOEFL scores) have been sent to Georgia Tech, but my application status is still showing incomplete due to missing documents. Should I resend missing documents?","No. The application status checking page shows what has been received and processed. Transcripts must be scanned in order to be added to the database, and some of the data from other documents must be entered manually into the database. This takes time, especially near the application deadlines, since Georgia Tech receives thousands of applications each year, many of them arriving right before the application deadlines. Documents arriving during school holidays and school breaks will not be posted during that time (see a list of upcoming school holidays and breaks). A minimum of 10 working days is typically required to process received documents. Be sure you have allowed sufficient time for the materials to be sent and processed.ÿIf any of the materials you sent or arranged to be sent to Georgia Tech are not acknowledged as received, you should contact the Office of Graduate Studies. Do not contact ECE inquiring about the status of these materials as they are received and processed by the Office of Graduate Studies."
How can I check if my letters of recommendation have been received by Georgia Tech?,"Your recommenders submit your letters of recommendation directly to the Georgia Tech Office of Graduate Studies. To check the status of these letters, go to the application status checking page. On this page you can view the most current information regarding the status of your application including received materials. Do not contact ECE regarding the status or your letters of recommendation, as they are received and processed by the Office of Graduate Studies."
When and how will I be informed if I have been admitted?,"For Atlanta campus M.S. and Ph.D. admissions: We will send out decisions as they are made, starting as early as January, with the vast majority completed by late March (for applications for fall admission). For B.S./M.S. admissions: Admission decisions will be made by the end of the preceding summer semester if not sooner and will be accessible through your Gradapp account. Spring admissions decisions will be relayed by the end of the preceding fall semester and will be accessible through your Gradapp account. Decision available notification is sent to the email address as listed on the application. You are responsible to ensure that this email address remains accessible to receive communications from our office. As admission decisions are made, some admission decision letters will be available for direct download in Adobe pdf format. If your decision letter is available for download, you will be informed via email and there will be a link provided on the ECE Application Decision Status site to download your letter. If you do not receive an email that your admission decision letter can be downloaded and no link for downloading a letter appears on the ECE Application Decision Status website, your letter will be emailed to you using the email address on the application."
"I was not accepted into Georgia Tech, yet someone that I know whose qualifications seem worse than mine was accepted. Why is that?","First of all, students do not know all of the details on their own application (specifically, their letters of recommendation) and certainly not the details of another person?s application. When students have contacted us in the past with this question, we find that they are usually mistaken about other student?s records. Even so, we understand that we do deny admission to many excellent students due to program capacity limitations, and this is not a reflection on their qualifications. If a group of students all have equivalent grades and test scores, then other factors will influence the decision, such as: letters of recommendation, the statement of purpose and prior experience, and the alignment between the student?s area of interest and our needs within ECE. For example, a student may have research or work experience that exactly matches the need of a particular faculty member who has an open research assistantship position. That student may be admitted with lower a GPA and/or test scores than someone else since the experience is weighted more heavily in that case. Alternatively, a particular research concentration area may have a large number of applicants compared to other areas, and we may need to balance the number of students across these areas to align with the needs of our faculty."
